# Prototype

## Introduction

This is just a hobby project I took upon myself, during my school days, to explore the possibilities of C++ base graphics and postfix conversions. The same acted as a prototype for *Graphilia* here. 


## Programming Language

The whole code is written in **C++** making use of **Turbo C++** as an IDE.

#### C++ Libraries used:
- conio
- math
- dos
- stdio
- stdlib
- string
- iostream
- ctype
- graphics
- process
